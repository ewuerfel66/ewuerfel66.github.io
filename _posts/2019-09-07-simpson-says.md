Check out [Simpson Says](https://simpsonsays.netlify.com/), our new web app where you can search for and save your favorite quotes from the Simpsons!

Using a corpus of dialogue from episodes of the Simpsons, we used Scikit-learn to create a k-nearest neighbors model to search for quotes given a string.

My main responsibility in this project was to create a Flask API that connected our model to the backend of our web app.
