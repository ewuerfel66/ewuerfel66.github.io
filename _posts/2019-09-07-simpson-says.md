Check out [Simpson Says](https://simpsonsays.netlify.com/), our new web app where you can search for and save your favorite quotes from the Simpsons!

Using a corpus of dialogue from episodes of the Simpsons, we used Scikit-learn to create a k-nearest neighbors model to search for quotes given a string. If you're interested in the codebase, check out our [Simpson Says Github Page](https://github.com/Build-Week-Simpson-Says/DS).

My main responsibilities were:
  * Created a Flask API to connect our model to the backend of our web app
  * Cleaning and organizing data
