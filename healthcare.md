As of 2016, the United States spent about 17% of our GDP on Health Care according to data from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS?end=2016&locations=GB-US-EU-FR-DE&most_recent_value_desc=true&start=2016&view=bar). France and Germany come in second and third place, spending about 11.5% and 11% respectively. The United States is a uniquely large and diverse country, so comparing ourselves to our European counterparts could be misleading. The European Union as a whole matches America's population better. Averaging across countries, the European Union spent only about 10% of their GDP on Health Care in 2016.

Look, Health Care is a tricky business. The life or death nature of Health Care transactions makes the industry ripe for regulation. Patients in life threatening situations have no leverage to negotiate prices, which can lead to market failure. On the contrary, opaque regulation in Health Care causes information asymmetry in the market, which can also lead to market failure. The government has a compelling interest in the health of all it's citizens (particularly the labor force).

How do we discriminate between necessary regulations to protect consumers, and opaque regulations that hurt consumers?
