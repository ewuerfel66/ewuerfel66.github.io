title: Digital Dialogue
subtitle: How has technology shaped the way we communicate?
---

As a part of the first generation to have cell phones (basic, though they were) at a young age, I've seen how text messages have shaped our dialogue. There are certain rules, a type of etiquitte one uses over text: don't end a text with a period unless you're angry, don't sign your name at the end of a text, etc.

Nobody writes these down for the most part. These rules are *emergent properties* generated by the interaction of people in a network. These emergent properties aren't arbitrary by any means, they function within the constraints of the network. This is why a Tweet reads and feels very differently than an email.

Although digital communication allows us to communicate with more people than ever, it seriously reduces the quality of that communication. For a while, this poor style of communication was confined to middle schoolers breaking up over text, but digital communication has now entered our corporations, media and body politic.
