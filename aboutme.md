- Husband.
- Data Engineer.
- Musician.

As a college student, I was drawn into physics because I like to create and test quantitative models of reality. Research in physics has become quite specialized, but the data processing methods are widely applicable. Working with 16 kHz gravitational wave data gave me my first reason to use distributed computing.

After graduation, I beefed up my coding skills at LambdaSchool. I got my first experience working on an Agile team and developed a more consumer-focused mindset.

Since then, I’ve been building automated production data ingestion processes as a part of Lowe’s Digital Analytics and Computational Insights (DACI) team.

I dabble with ML in my spare time, but believe there is a lot that can be accomplished with the data alone.
