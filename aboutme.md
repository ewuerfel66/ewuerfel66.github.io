- Data nerd.
- Dog lover.
- Musician.

I went into Physics because I like to create and test quantitative models. Research in Physics has become quite specialized, but the methods are widely applicable. My desire to apply quantitative methods to a wider variety of real-world problems led me to Data Science at Lambda School.

I've used BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape data from a bunch of different online sources. I can create integrated data pipelines to collect and process data from APIs, RSS feeds and websites. Scikit-learn and Tensorflow with Keras are my tools for machine learning. In addition to linear and logistic regressions, I've trained k-nearest neighbor, random forest and decision tree models for use in web applications. To connect models to applications, I create Flask APIs that take requests and return output from the model.
